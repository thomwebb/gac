"""Git diff display command for gac.

This module implements the 'gac diff' subcommand which displays git diffs with various
filtering and formatting options. It provides a convenient way to view staged or unstaged
changes, compare commits, and apply smart filtering to focus on meaningful code changes.

Key features:
- Display staged or unstaged changes
- Compare specific commits or branches
- Filter out binary files, minified files, and lockfiles
- Smart truncation of large diffs based on token limits
- Colored output support for better readability
- Integration with gac's preprocessing logic for cleaner diffs

The diff command is particularly useful for:
- Previewing what changes will be included in the commit message
- Reviewing filtered diffs before committing
- Comparing code changes between branches or commits
- Understanding what files have been modified in the staging area

    Display the diff of staged or unstaged changes.

    This command shows the raw diff without generating a commit message.

    You can also compare specific commits or branches by providing one or two arguments:
        gac diff <commit1> - Shows diff between working tree and <commit1>
        gac diff <commit1> <commit2> - Shows diff between <commit1> and <commit2>

    Commit references can be commit hashes, branch names, or other Git references.
