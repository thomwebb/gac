## Basic Usage

```sh
gac init
# Then follow the prompts to configure your provider, model, and API keys interactively
gac
```

Generates an LLM-powered commit message for staged changes and prompts for confirmation. The confirmation prompt accepts:

- `y` or `yes` - Proceed with the commit
- `n` or `no` - Cancel the commit
- `r` or `reroll` - Regenerate the commit message with the same context
- `e` or `edit` - Edit the commit message. By default, opens an in-place TUI with vi/emacs keybindings. Set `GAC_EDITOR` to open your preferred editor instead (e.g., `GAC_EDITOR=code gac` for VS Code, `GAC_EDITOR=vim gac` for vim)
- Any other text - Regenerate with that text as feedback (e.g., `make it shorter`, `focus on performance`)
- Empty input (just Enter) - Show the prompt again

## Core Workflow Flags

| Flag / Option        | Short | Description                                                      |
| -------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--add-all`          | `-a`  | Stage all changes before committing                              |
| `--stage`            | `-S`  | Interactively select files to stage with a tree-based TUI        |
| `--group`            | `-g`  | Group staged changes into multiple logical commits               |
| `--push`             | `-p`  | Push changes to remote after committing                          |
| `--yes`              | `-y`  | Automatically confirm commit without prompting                   |
| `--dry-run`          |       | Show what would happen without making any changes                |
| `--message-only`     |       | Output only the generated commit message without committing      |
| `--no-verify`        |       | Skip pre-commit and lefthook hooks when committing               |
| `--skip-secret-scan` |       | Skip security scan for secrets in staged changes                 |
| `--no-verify-ssl`    |       | Skip SSL certificate verification (useful for corporate proxies) |
| `--signoff`          |       | Add Signed-off-by line to the commit message (DCO compliance)    |
| `--interactive`      | `-i`  | Ask questions about the changes to generate better commits       |

**Note:** `--stage` and `--add-all` are mutually exclusive. Use `--stage` to interactively select which files to stage, and `--add-all` to stage all changes at once.

**Note:** Combine `-a` and `-g` (i.e., `-ag`) to stage ALL changes first, then group them into commits.

**Note:** When using `--group`, the max output tokens limit is automatically scaled based on the number of files being committed (2x for 1-9 files, 3x for 10-19 files, 4x for 20-29 files, 5x for 30+ files). This ensures the LLM has enough tokens to generate all grouped commits without truncation, even for large changesets.

**Note:** `--message-only` and `--group` are mutually exclusive. Use `--message-only` when you want to get the commit message for external processing, and `--group` when you want to organize multiple commits within the current git workflow.

**Note:** The `--interactive` flag asks you questions about your changes to provide additional context to the LLM, resulting in more accurate and detailed commit messages. This is particularly helpful for complex changes or when you want to ensure the commit message captures the full context of your work.

## Message Customization

| Flag / Option       | Short | Description                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--one-liner`       | `-o`  | Generate a single-line commit message                                     |
| `--verbose`         | `-v`  | Generate detailed commit messages with motivation, architecture, & impact |
| `--hint <text>`     | `-h`  | Add a hint to guide the LLM                                               |
| `--model <model>`   | `-m`  | Specify the model to use for this commit                                  |
| `--language <lang>` | `-l`  | Override the language (name or code: 'Spanish', 'es', 'zh-CN', 'ja')      |
| `--scope`           | `-s`  | Infer an appropriate scope for the commit                                 |
| `--50-72`           |       | Enforce the 50/72 rule for commit message formatting                      |

**Note:** The `--50-72` flag enforces the [50/72 rule](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) where:

- Subject line: maximum 50 characters
- Body lines: maximum 72 characters per line
- This keeps commit messages readable in `git log --oneline` and GitHub's UI

You can also set `GAC_USE_50_72_RULE=true` in your `.gac.env` file to always apply this rule.

**Note:** You can provide feedback interactively by simply typing it at the confirmation prompt - no need to prefix with 'r'. Type `r` for a simple reroll, `e` to edit the message (in-place TUI by default, or your `$GAC_EDITOR` if set), or type your feedback directly like `make it shorter`.

## Output and Verbosity

| Flag / Option         | Short | Description                                             |
| --------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--quiet`             | `-q`  | Suppress all output except errors                       |
| `--log-level <level>` |       | Set log level (debug, info, warning, error)             |
| `--show-prompt`       |       | Print the LLM prompt used for commit message generation |

## Help and Version

| Flag / Option | Short | Description                |
| ------------- | ----- | -------------------------- |
| `--version`   |       | Show gac version and exit  |
| `--help`      |       | Show help message and exit |

---

## Example Workflows

- **Stage all changes and commit:**

  ```sh
  gac -a
  ```

- **Commit and push in one step:**

  ```sh
  gac -ap
  ```

- **Generate a one-line commit message:**

  ```sh
  gac -o
  ```

- **Generate a detailed commit message with structured sections:**

  ```sh
  gac -v
  ```

- **Add a hint for the LLM:**

  ```sh
  gac -h "Refactor authentication logic"
  ```

- **Infer scope for the commit:**

  ```sh
  gac -s
  ```

- **Group staged changes into logical commits:**

  ```sh
  gac -g
  # Groups only the files you've already staged
  ```

- **Group all changes (staged + unstaged) and auto-confirm:**

  ```sh
  gac -agy
  # Stages everything, groups it, and auto-confirms
  ```

- **Use a specific model just for this commit:**

  ```sh
  gac -m anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5
  ```

- **Generate commit message in a specific language:**

  ```sh
  # Using language codes (shorter)
  gac -l zh-CN
  gac -l ja
  gac -l es

  # Using full names
  gac -l "Simplified Chinese"
  gac -l Japanese
  gac -l Spanish
  ```

- **Dry run (see what would happen):**

  ```sh
  gac --dry-run
  ```

- **Get only the commit message (for script integration):**

  ```sh
  gac --message-only
  # Outputs: feat: add user authentication system
  ```

- **Get commit message in one-liner format:**

  ```sh
  gac --message-only --one-liner
  # Outputs: feat: add user authentication system
  ```

- **Use interactive mode to provide context:**

  ```sh
  gac -i
  # What is the main purpose of these changes?
  # What problem are you solving?
  # Are there any implementation details worth mentioning?
  ```

- **Interactive mode with verbose output:**

  ```sh
  gac -i -v
  # Ask questions and generate detailed commit message
  ```

## Advanced

- Combine flags for more powerful workflows (e.g., `gac -ayp` to stage, auto-confirm, and push)
- Use `--show-prompt` to debug or review the prompt sent to the LLM
- Adjust verbosity with `--log-level` or `--quiet`
- Use `--message-only` for script integration and automated workflows

### Script Integration and External Processing

The `--message-only` flag is designed for script integration and external tool workflows. It outputs only the raw commit message without any formatting, spinners, or additional UI elements.

**Use cases:**

- **Agent integration:** Allow AI agents to get commit messages and handle commits themselves
- **Alternative VCS:** Use generated messages with other version control systems (Mercurial, Jujutsu, etc.)
- **Custom commit workflows:** Process or modify the message before committing
- **CI/CD pipelines:** Extract commit messages for automated processes

**Example script usage:**

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Get commit message and use with custom commit function
MESSAGE=$(gac --message-only --add-all --yes)
git commit -m "$MESSAGE"
```

```python
# Python integration example
import subprocess

def get_commit_message():
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["gac", "--message-only", "--yes"],
        capture_output=True, text=True
    )
    return result.stdout.strip()

message = get_commit_message()
print(f"Generated message: {message}")
```

**Key features for script usage:**

- Clean output with no Rich formatting or spinners
- Automatically bypasses confirmation prompts
- No actual commit is made to git
- Works with `--one-liner` for simplified output
- Can be combined with other flags like `--hint`, `--model`, etc.

### Skipping Pre-commit and Lefthook Hooks

The `--no-verify` flag allows you to skip any pre-commit or lefthook hooks configured in your project:

```sh
gac --no-verify  # Skip all pre-commit and lefthook hooks
```

**Use `--no-verify` when:**

- Pre-commit or lefthook hooks are failing temporarily
- Working with time-consuming hooks
- Committing work-in-progress code that doesn't pass all checks yet

**Note:** Use with caution as these hooks maintain code quality standards.

### Security Scanning

gac includes built-in security scanning that automatically detects potential secrets and API keys in your staged changes before committing. This helps prevent accidentally committing sensitive information.

**Skipping security scans:**

```sh
gac --skip-secret-scan  # Skip security scan for this commit
```

**To disable permanently:** Set `GAC_SKIP_SECRET_SCAN=true` in your `.gac.env` file.

**When to skip:**

- Committing example code with placeholder keys
- Working with test fixtures that contain dummy credentials
- When you've verified the changes are safe

**Note:** The scanner uses pattern matching to detect common secret formats. Always review your staged changes before committing.

### SSL Certificate Verification

gac supports skipping SSL certificate verification for environments where corporate proxies intercept SSL traffic and cause certificate verification failures.

**Skipping SSL verification:**

```sh
gac --no-verify-ssl  # Skip SSL verification for this commit
```

**To disable permanently:** Set `GAC_NO_VERIFY_SSL=true` in your `.gac.env` file, or add `no_verify_ssl=true` to your configuration.

**When to use:**

- Corporate environments with SSL-intercepting proxies
- Development environments with self-signed certificates
- When you encounter SSL certificate verification errors

**Note:** Disabling SSL verification reduces security. Only use this option when necessary and in trusted network environments.

### Signed-off-by Line (DCO Compliance)

gac supports adding a `Signed-off-by` line to commit messages, which is required for [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) compliance in many open-source projects.

**Adding signoff:**

```sh
gac --signoff  # Add Signed-off-by line to the commit
```

**To enable permanently:** Set `GAC_SIGNOFF=true` in your `.gac.env` file, or add `signoff=true` to your configuration.

**What it does:**

- Appends `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>` to the commit message
- Uses your git config (`user.name` and `user.email`) to populate the line
- Required for projects like Cherry Studio, Linux kernel, and others using DCO

**Setting up your git identity:**

Ensure your git config has the correct name and email:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**Note:** The signoff line is added by git during the commit, not by the AI during message generation. You won't see it in the preview, but it will be in the final commit (check with `git log -1`).

## Configuration Notes

- The recommended way to set up gac is to run `gac init` and follow the interactive prompts.
- Already configured language and just need to switch providers or models? Run `gac model` to repeat the setup without language questions.
- **Using Claude Code?** See the [Claude Code setup guide](CLAUDE_CODE.md) for OAuth authentication instructions.
- **Using ChatGPT OAuth?** See the [ChatGPT OAuth setup guide](CHATGPT_OAUTH.md) for browser-based authentication instructions.
- **Using GitHub Copilot?** See the [GitHub Copilot setup guide](GITHUB_COPILOT.md) for Device Flow authentication instructions.
- gac loads configuration in the following order of precedence:
  1. CLI flags
  2. Environment variables
  3. Project-level `.gac.env`
  4. User-level `~/.gac.env`

### Advanced Configuration Options

You can customize gac's behavior with these optional environment variables:

- `GAC_EDITOR=code --wait` - Override the editor used when you press `e` at the confirmation prompt. By default, `e` opens an in-place TUI; setting `GAC_EDITOR` switches to an external editor. Supports any editor command with arguments. Wait flags (`--wait`/`-w`) are auto-inserted for known GUI editors (VS Code, Cursor, Zed, Sublime Text) so the process blocks until you close the file
- `GAC_ALWAYS_INCLUDE_SCOPE=true` - Automatically infer and include scope in commit messages (e.g., `feat(auth):` vs `feat:`)
- `GAC_VERBOSE=true` - Generate detailed commit messages with motivation, architecture, and impact sections
- `GAC_USE_50_72_RULE=true` - Always enforce the 50/72 rule for commit messages (subject ≤50 chars, body lines ≤72 chars)
- `GAC_SIGNOFF=true` - Always add Signed-off-by line to commits (for DCO compliance)
- `GAC_TEMPERATURE=0.7` - Control LLM creativity (0.0-1.0, lower = more focused)
- `GAC_REASONING_EFFORT=medium` - Control reasoning/thinking depth for models that support extended thinking (low, medium, high). Leave unset to use each model's default. Only sent to compatible providers (OpenAI-style; not Anthropic).
- `GAC_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=4096` - Maximum tokens for generated messages (automatically scaled 2-5x when using `--group` based on file count; override to go higher or lower)
- `GAC_WARNING_LIMIT_TOKENS=4096` - Warn when prompts exceed this token count
- `GAC_SYSTEM_PROMPT_PATH=/path/to/custom_prompt.txt` - Use a custom system prompt for commit message generation
- `GAC_LANGUAGE=Spanish` - Generate commit messages in a specific language (e.g., Spanish, French, Japanese, German). Supports full names or ISO codes (es, fr, ja, de, zh-CN). Use `gac language` for interactive selection
- `GAC_TRANSLATE_PREFIXES=true` - Translate conventional commit prefixes (feat, fix, etc.) into the target language (default: false, keeps prefixes in English)
- `GAC_SKIP_SECRET_SCAN=true` - Disable automatic security scanning for secrets in staged changes (use with caution)
- `GAC_NO_VERIFY_SSL=true` - Skip SSL certificate verification for API calls (useful for corporate proxies that intercept SSL traffic)
- `GAC_DISABLE_STATS=true` - Disable usage statistics tracking (no stats file reads or writes; existing data is preserved). Only truthy values disable stats; setting it to `false`/`0`/`no`/`off` keeps stats enabled, same as leaving it unset

See `.gac.env.example` for a complete configuration template.

For detailed guidance on creating custom system prompts, see [docs/CUSTOM_SYSTEM_PROMPTS.md](docs/CUSTOM_SYSTEM_PROMPTS.md).

## Interactive Mode

The `--interactive` (`-i`) flag enhances gac's commit message generation by asking you targeted questions about your changes. This additional context helps the LLM create more accurate, detailed, and contextually appropriate commit messages.

### How It Works

When you use `--interactive`, gac will prompt you with questions such as:

- **What is the main purpose of these changes?** - Helps understand the high-level goal
- **What problem are you solving?** - Provides context about the motivation
- **Are there any implementation details worth mentioning?** - Captures technical specifics
- **Are there any breaking changes?** - Identifies potential impact issues
- **Is this related to any issue or ticket?** - Links to project management

### When to Use Interactive Mode

Interactive mode is particularly useful for:

- **Complex changes** where the context isn't obvious from the diff alone
- **Refactoring work** that spans multiple files and concepts
- **New features** that require explanation of the overall purpose
- **Bug fixes** where the root cause isn't immediately visible
- **Performance optimizations** where the reasoning isn't obvious
- **Code review preparation** - the questions help you think through your changes

### Usage Examples

**Basic interactive mode:**

```sh
gac -i
```

This will:

1. Show you a summary of staged changes
2. Ask you questions about the changes
3. Generate a commit message incorporating your answers
4. Prompt for confirmation (or auto-confirm if combined with `-y`)

**Interactive mode with staged changes:**

```sh
gac -ai
# Stage all changes, then ask questions for better context
```

**Interactive mode with specific hints:**

```sh
gac -i -h "Database migration for user profiles"
# Ask questions while providing a specific hint to focus the LLM
```

**Interactive mode with verbose output:**

```sh
gac -i -v
# Ask questions and generate a detailed, structured commit message
```

**Auto-confirmed interactive mode:**

```sh
gac -i -y
# Ask questions but auto-confirm the resulting commit
```

### Question-Answering Workflow

The interactive workflow follows this pattern:

1. **Review changes** - gac shows a summary of what you're committing
2. **Answer questions** - respond to each prompt with relevant details
3. **Context enhancement** - your answers are added to the LLM prompt
4. **Message generation** - the LLM creates a commit message with full context
5. **Confirmation** - review and confirm the commit (or auto-confirm with `-y`)

**Tips for providing helpful answers:**

- **Be concise but thorough** - provide the key details without being overly verbose
- **Focus on the "why"** - explain the reasoning behind your changes
- **Mention constraints** - note any limitations or special considerations
- **Link to external context** - reference issues, documentation, or design docs
- **Empty answers are fine** - if a question doesn't apply, just press Enter

### Combining with Other Flags

Interactive mode works well with most other flags:

```sh
# Stage all changes and ask questions
gac -ai

# Ask questions with verbose output
gac -i -v
```

### Best Practices

- **Use for complex PRs** - especially helpful for pull requests that need detailed descriptions
- **Team collaboration** - the questions help you think through changes that others will review
- **Documentation preparation** - your answers can help form the basis for release notes
- **Learning tool** - the questions reinforce good commit message practices
- **Skip when making simple changes** - for trivial fixes, basic mode may be faster

## Usage Statistics

gac tracks lightweight usage statistics so you can see your commit activity, streaks, token usage, and most-active projects and models. Stats are stored locally in `~/.gac_stats.json` and never sent anywhere — there is no telemetry.

**What's tracked:** total gac runs, total commits, total prompt, output, and reasoning tokens, first/last used dates, daily and weekly counts (gacs, commits, tokens), current and longest streak, per-project activity (gacs, commits, tokens), and per-model activity (gacs, tokens).

**What's NOT tracked:** commit messages, code content, file paths, personal information, or anything beyond counts, dates, project names (derived from git remote or directory name), and model names.

### Opting In or Out

`gac init` asks whether to enable stats and explains exactly what's stored. You can change your mind at any time:

- **Enable stats:** unset `GAC_DISABLE_STATS` or set it to `false`/`0`/`no`/`off`/empty.
- **Disable stats:** set `GAC_DISABLE_STATS` to a truthy value (`true`, `1`, `yes`, `on`).

When you decline stats during `gac init` and an existing `~/.gac_stats.json` is detected, you'll be offered the option to delete it.

gac stats models

# Stats for all projects
gac stats projects

# Reset all stats (with confirmation prompt)
gac stats reset

# Reset stats for a specific model
gac stats reset model wafer:deepseek-v4-pro
```

### What You'll See

Running `gac stats` displays:

- **Total gacs and commits** — how many times you've used gac and how many commits it created
- **Current and longest streak** — consecutive days with gac activity (🔥 at 5+ days)
- **Activity summary** — today's and this week's gacs, commits, and tokens vs your peak day and peak week
- **Top projects** — your 5 most-active repos by gac + commit count, with token usage per project

Running `gac stats projects` shows **all** projects (not just the top 5) with:

- **All Projects table** — every project sorted by activity, with gac count, commit count, prompt tokens, output tokens, reasoning tokens, and total tokens
- **Top models** — your 5 most-used models with prompt, output, and total tokens consumed

Running `gac stats models` shows **all** models (not just the top 5) with:

- **All Models table** — every model you've used sorted by activity, with gac count, speed (tokens/sec), prompt tokens, output tokens, reasoning tokens, and total tokens
- **Speed Comparison chart** — a horizontal bar chart of all models with known speeds, sorted fastest to slowest, color-coded by speed percentile (🟡 blazing, 🟢 fast, 🔵 moderate, 🔘 slow)
- **High score celebrations** — 🏆 trophies when you set new daily, weekly, token, or streak records; 🥈 for tying them
- **Encouragement messages** — contextual nudges based on your activity

### Disabling Stats

Set the `GAC_DISABLE_STATS` environment variable to a truthy value:

```sh
# Disable stats tracking
export GAC_DISABLE_STATS=true

# Or in .gac.env
GAC_DISABLE_STATS=true
```

Falsy values (`false`, `0`, `no`, `off`, empty) keep stats enabled — the same as leaving the variable unset.

When disabled, gac skips all stats recording — no file reads or writes occur. Existing data is preserved but won't be updated until you re-enable.
